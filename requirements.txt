# VPN App Requirements
# Note: This app uses built-in Python libraries (tkinter, subprocess, etc.)
# No external dependencies required for basic functionality

# Optional: For Windows registry operations (already built into Python)
# pywin32  # Only needed if you want explicit Windows registry access, but winreg is built-in

# Optional: For .env file support (if you want to use python-dotenv)
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
